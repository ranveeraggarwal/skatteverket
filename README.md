Automation script to fill in tax data on Skatteverket
===

Especially useful if you have foreign taxes.

The tax_data is expected in the following format:

Dividend/Interest,Country,Month,Day,Currency,Amount,TP,TP_Currency,TP_Amount

where TP = Tax Paid, if you already have any tax paid on the amount. The name of the country and the month need to be in Swedish as in the example.
